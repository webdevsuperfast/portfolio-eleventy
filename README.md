## üß∞ Tools

This project uses the following frameworks:

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/)

It also uses the following build tools:

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Requirements

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

## üõ† Getting Started

- `nvm use` to switch to the valid node version
- `npm i` to build that big ol' `node_modules` folder
- `npm run dev` to boot up a live-reloading dev server
- `npm run build` to build your production-ready site

Feel free to peep the `package.json` file to see all available scripts and packages being utilized.

### üî• Tip:

Running `npm run build && npx serve dist` will boot up a local server of your production site to preview before deployment.
